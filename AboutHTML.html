	        <h2>Location</h2>
	        <p class="aboutText">This documentary was filmed at various locations within the UK and most of it was filmed within two separate days, the 26th of November and 3rd of December 2018. On the 3rd of December, the crew travelled to Manchester, specifically to MediaCityUK and the University of Salford's media campus buildings to gain footage of a real LAN tournament of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.<br><br>Another large portion of this film was shot in the student accommodation of the crew members, where their computers were set up at the time and the rest of the clips were screen captures taken from my personal computer, the same one used to edit this short film.

	        <h2>Equipment</h2>
	        <p>The recording equipment used in the production of this short film are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li><p class="listPoint"><b>Primary Camera</b> - Panasonic AG-DVX200 in 3840x2160 @ 50fps</p></li>
			    <li><p class="listPoint"><b>Secondary Camera</b> - GoPro HERO4 Session in 1920x1440 @ 30fps</p></li>
			    <li><p class="listPoint"><b>Primary Microphone</b> - Audio Technica 8015 Microphone</p></li>
			    <li><p class="listPoint"><b>Secondary Microphone</b> - iPhone 6s+</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="aboutText">The secondary equipment was used when the primary equipment was unavailable or unsuitable for use. For example, in the documentary, there is a shot where the camera is directly over the subject, held by an extension arm on a tripod. The larger Panasonic camera would be far too heavy to reasonably rig up, so the much lighter GoPro was used instead.</p>
